## There are huge difficulties in the installation and using of the Yocto Project, here is the correct installation procedure that I figured out during my course work and project building. This repository is mainly for those who are trying to build their Yocto project in WSL.

# Project ---> Yocto on RaspberryPi3
## The whole project work has been done in WSL-2 Ubuntu 22.04.03 LTS.
* For installation and setup followup the ```installation or setup``` folder.
* For executing the Project followup the ```Project``` folder
